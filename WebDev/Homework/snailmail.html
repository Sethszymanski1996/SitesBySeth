      <h3 class="heading">What It Escargot?</h3>
      <p>
        Escargot, means "edible snail", seems to date from 1892 and is a cooked
        land snail. Not all species of land snail are edible, and many are too
        small to make it worthwhile to prepare and cook them. Even among the
        edible species, the palatability of the flesh varies from species to
        species. In France, the species "Helix pomatia" is most often eaten.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading">How Is It Prepared?</h3>
      <p>
        In French cuisine, the snails are typically purged, killed, removed from
        their shells, and cooked (usually with garlic butter, chicken soup or
        wine), and then placed back into the shells with the butter and sauce
        for serving. Additional ingredients may be added, such as garlic, thyme,
        parsley and pine nuts. Special snail tongs (for holding the shell) and
        snail forks (for extracting the meat) are also normally provided, and
        they are served on indented metal trays with places for six or 12
        snails.
